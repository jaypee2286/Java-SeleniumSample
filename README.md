# SeleniumSample
This is a sample Selenium framework designed to show working knowledge of Selenium WebDriver (Java).

Included are the following:
	- test case file (src/data/TestCases.xlsx)
	- Junit class for the test case (src/testCases/TC001.java)
	- Junit suite class (src/suites/JunitSuiteDriver.java)
	- TestNG class for the test case (src/testCases/TestNG_TC001.java)
	- Object repository (src/objectRepository/OR_Bing.java)
	- Base class for repository (src/objectRepository/Base.java)
	- Utilities class (src/utility/ObjectUtils.java)
	- log4j.xml config file
	- TestNG suite config file (TestNG_Suite.xml)
	
The framework is a modular one. Currently the tests include all of the steps in the class.

In the future, common actions can be consolidated into Methods of Functions classes, forming
	a hybrid modular/keyword-driven framework.
